# Fetal Distress Prediction using Cardiotocography Data

This repository contains the code and resources for the **2025 Datathon** competition, where the goal was to predict fetal distress in expectant mothers using cardiotocography (CTG) data. The model classifies the CTG data into three categories: **Normal**, **Suspect**, and **Pathologic** to assist healthcare professionals in timely decision-making during labor.

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on using machine learning to analyze CTG (Fetal Heart Rate and Uterine Contractions) data to predict the fetal state. The main challenge is to build a reliable model that can distinguish between three categories of fetal health:
- **Normal**: No immediate concern.
- **Suspect**: Warning signs present, requiring monitoring.
- **Pathologic**: High risk of distress, requiring urgent attention.
The dataset used is the **UCI Cardiotocography dataset**, which includes real-world data from over 2,000 CTG traces labeled by obstetricians.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **UCI Cardiotocography dataset**, which contains 2,000+ CTG traces recorded from expectant mothers. The dataset includes features such as:

- **LB (Baseline Heart Rate)**: The resting heart rate of the fetus.
- **AC (Accelerations)**: Short bursts of increased heart rate.
- **FM (Fetal Movements)**: The movements of the fetus.
- **UC (Uterine Contractions)**: The tightening of the uterus during labor.
- **DL, DS, DP (Decelerations)**: Sudden drops in the heart rate.
- **ASTV, ALTV (Short-Term and Long-Term Variability)**: Measures of heart rate variability.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Models

The following machine learning models were implemented for the classification task:

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest

- Gradient Boosting

- SVC
  
- SMOTE


## Evaluation Metrics


- Balanced Accuracy: Ensures that all classes are treated fairly.

- Macro F1-Score: Balances precision and recall across all classes.

## Results

The results show that the model is reliable in detecting pathologic cases of fetal distress.
